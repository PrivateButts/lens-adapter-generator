**What project is this for?**

Is this an official plate or a community project? Give us a brief overview and some links.

**What fields would the generator form need?**

List each field and what input type it'll be, for example:

- "Serial Number", text input, placeholder "VX.XXXX", settable from the URL GET parameter "serial"
- "Extrusion Size", select, default 2020
    - Option "2020", Labeled "2020 (Voron 2.4)"
    - Option "1515", Labeled "1515 (Voron 0)"
- "Include Logo", checkbox, default ticked


**Attach the SCAD files for the plate and any additional files required for the generator**

Make sure you include any fonts, stls, etc needed to compile your SCAD project.

**Does your project have a preferred accent color to use for form widgets and the stl preview?**

Provide it in a CSS friendly format, like HEX or RGB.

**Attach or link a project logo or icon**

SVG is preferred
